An overview of the topics I've worked on as a middling space scientist. You can find a full list of my published works at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UeDZe60AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> Google Scholar</a>.

### Imaging Saturn's Ultraviolet Auroras

These papers explore how Saturn's ultraviolet auroral emissions can be used as a diagnostic for magnetospheric dynamics and weird planetary rotation effects. Mainly using images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini missions.

"Tracking Counterpart Signatures in Saturn's Auroras and ENA Imagery During Large-Scale Plasma Injection Events." Open access at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JA027542"> Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>.

*Using data from two instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft, UVIS & INCA, this paper demonstrates how remote sensing imagery can be used to motion-track the signatures of magnetospheric plasma dynamics in Saturn's auroral and ENA emissions.*

* **Kinrade, J.**, Badman, S.V., Provan, G., Cowley, S.W.H., Lamy, L., and Bader, A. (2018). "Saturn's northern auroras and their modulation by rotating current systems during late northern spring in early 2014." Open access at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025426"> Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>.

*I still cringe at the stupid title, but I have a soft spot for this being the first paper I published using images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The intensity of Saturn's ultraviolet auroras changes in response to giant current systems that rotate around the entire planet every ~10 hours. This work attempted to reveal this modulation during a particularly odd stage of Saturn's long seasonal cycle when the north and south current systems semi-synchronised.*

### Imaging Saturn's Magnetosphere

These papers examine other remote sensing-based observations of Saturn's space environment, namely kilometric radio bursts and energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). First detected at Earth, ENAs are kind of like photons, but with a mass and chemical signature. Think of them as a tracer for active plasma dynamics. They can be imaged - just like photons on a CCD - to give a picture of the global plasma structure in giant magnetospheres.

"The Statistical Morphology of Saturnâ€™s Equatorial Energetic Neutral Atom Emission." Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091595"> Geophysical Research Letters</a>.

*This letter highlights the first science results following a complete reworking of the ENA imagery captured by Cassini's Ion-Neutral CAmera - INCA. Equatorial projections show that - in the long term picture -  ENAs are emitted mostly from a torus region around the planet between 7-10 Rs, which is brighter on the nightside and displays a day-night-side position offset.*

### Earth's Ionosphere: Tomographic Imaging

My early career research involved imaging of Earth's high latitude ionosphere using a method called *tomographic inversion*. It's a way of finding solutions to inverse problems, like sudoku, or X-raying the body to reconstruct a skeleton. But in this case, radio signals from GNSS (GPS, Galileo, etc.) satellites are used to scan the Earth's ionosphere using a network of receivers dotted about Earth's surface. Essentially the same maths as X-ray CT, but scaled up.

### Earth's Ionosphere: Radiowave Scintillation

At high latitudes, solar activity and space weather can disturb the ionosphere (driving the auroras) as energetic particles hurtle down the magnetic field lines and impact the upper atmosphere. Subsequent turbulence can refract and scatter the propagation of GNSS signals, which then fluctuate not unlike the  twinkling of a star. This phenomenon is known as *scintillation*.  It also occurs at low latitudes because of equatorial heating effects. GNSS receivers don't like scintillation, and it can degrade positioning accuracy in systems demanding high precision  (airports, oil rigs, glacial tracking). But, conversely, it lets you use GNSS receivers to probe atmospheric phenomena like the auroras.
