### Imaging Saturn's Ultraviolet Auroras

These papers explore how Saturn's ultraviolet auroral emissions can be used as a diagnostic for magnetospheric dynamics and weird planetary rotation effects. Mainly using images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini missions.

Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JA027542"> Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>.

*Using data from two instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft, UVIS & INCA, this paper demonstrates how remote sensing imagery can be used to motion-track the signatures of magnetospheric plasma dynamics in Saturn's auroral and ENA emissions.*

### Imaging Saturn's Magnetosphere

These papers examine other remote sensing-based observations of Saturn's space environment, namely kilometric radio bursts and energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). First detected at Earth, ENAs are kind of like photons, but with a mass and chemical signature. Think of them as a tracer for active plasma dynamics. They can be imaged - just like photons on a CCD - to give a picture of the global plasma structure in giant magnetospheres.

"The Statistical Morphology of Saturnâ€™s Equatorial Energetic Neutral Atom Emission." Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091595"> Geophysical Research Letters</a>.

*This letter highlights the first science results following a complete reworking of the ENA imagery captured by Cassini's Ion-Neutral CAmera - INCA. Equatorial projections show that - in the long term picture -  ENAs are emitted mostly from a torus region around the planet between 7-10 Rs, which is brighter on the nightside and displays a day-night-side position offset.*

### Earth's Ionosphere: Tomographic Imaging & GNSS Scintillation

My early research career was spent imaging Earth's high latitude ionosphere using a technique called *tomographic inversion*. It's a way of finding solutions to inverse problems, like sudoku, or X-raying a human body to reconstruct skeletal structure. But in this case, radio signals from GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, etc.) satellites are used to scan the Earth's ionosphere using a network of receivers dotted about Earth's surface. At high latitudes, solar activity and space weather can disturb the ionosphere (driving the auroras) as energetic particles hurtle down the magnetic field lines and impact the upper atmosphere. Subsequent turbulence can refract and scatter the propagation of GNSS signals, which then fluctuate not unlike the pretty twinkling of a star. This phenomenon is known as *scintillation*. An exciting word for a not-very exciting radiowave propogation effect. GNSS receivers don't handle scintillation very well and it can degrade positioning accuracy in systems requiring precise location  (airports, oil rigs, glacial tracking). But conversely it also lets you use GNSS receivers to detect atmospheric turbulence, which is fortunate for PhD students studying ionospheric physics...
