An overview of the topics I've worked on as a middling space scientist. Usually involving remote sensing and imaging of some kind. Lots of thanks & credit to my past and present collaborators.

### Imaging Saturn's Ultraviolet Auroras

These papers explore how Saturn's ultraviolet auroral emissions can be used as a diagnostic for magnetospheric dynamics and weird planetary rotation effects. Mainly using images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini missions.

"Tracking Counterpart Signatures in Saturn's Auroras and ENA Imagery During Large-Scale Plasma Injection Events." Open access at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JA027542"> JGR Space Physics</a>.

*Using data from two instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft, UVIS & INCA, this paper demonstrates how remote sensing imagery can be used to motion-track the signatures of magnetospheric plasma dynamics in Saturn's auroral and ENA emissions. This work was presented at NAM2019 and won the Winton Prize.*

* **Kinrade, J.**, S.V. Badman, G. Provan, S.W.H. Cowley, L. Lamy, and A. Bader (2018). "Saturn's northern auroras and their modulation by rotating current systems during late northern spring in early 2014." Open access at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025426"> JGR Space Physics</a>.

*I still cringe at the stupid title, but I have a soft spot for this being the first paper I published using images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The intensity of Saturn's ultraviolet auroras changes in response to giant current systems that rotate around the entire planet every ~10 hours. This work attempted to reveal this modulation during a particularly odd stage of Saturn's long seasonal cycle when the north and south current systems semi-synchronised.*

### Imaging Saturn's Magnetosphere

These papers examine other remote sensing-based observations of Saturn's space environment, namely kilometric radio bursts and energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). First detected at Earth, ENAs are kind of like photons, but with a mass and chemical signature. Think of them as a tracer for active plasma dynamics. They can be imaged - just like photons on a CCD - to give a picture of the global plasma structure in giant magnetospheres.

"The Statistical Morphology of Saturn’s Equatorial Energetic Neutral Atom Emission." Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091595"> Geophysical Research Letters</a>.

*This letter highlights the first science results following a complete reworking of the ENA imagery captured by Cassini's Ion-Neutral CAmera - INCA. Equatorial projections show that - in the long term picture -  ENAs are emitted mostly from a torus-shaped region encircling the planet between 7-10 R<sub>S</sub> , which is brighter on the nightside and displays a day-night-side position offset.*

Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JA028908"> JGR Space Physics</a>.

*Companion to the above GRL, this is a methods paper detailing the reprocessing, calibration and projection of the entire set of INCA images captured during the Cassini tour. This new data set comprises equatorial projections of Saturn's ENA emission intensity in a common reference frame, plus lots of useful metadata, and is openly available as community resource <a href="https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/researchdata/384"> here</a>. A lot of work from joint-first author and data science magician Dr Alex Bader, and credit to the MIMI team at JHU APL (Dr Chris Paranicas & Professor Don Mitchell).*

### Earth's Ionosphere: Tomographic Imaging

My early career research involved imaging of Earth's high latitude ionosphere using a method called *tomographic inversion*. It's a way of finding solutions to inverse problems, like sudoku, or X-raying the body to reconstruct a skeleton. But in this case, radio signals from GNSS (GPS, Galileo, etc.) satellites are used to scan the Earth's ionosphere using a network of receivers dotted about Earth's surface. Essentially the same maths as X-ray CT, but scaled up. The polar regions have been historically sparse in GNSS receiver coverage (cold, inaccessible land mass), and the orbit constellation design means that satellites are never directly overhead in the sky, so the problem geometry is especially tricky.

* **Kinrade, J.**, C.N. Mitchell, P. Yin, N. Smith, M.J. Jarvis, D.J. Maxfield, M.C. Rose, G.S. Bust, and A.T. Weatherwax (2012). "Ionospheric scintillation over Antarctica during the storm of 5–6 April 2010." Open access at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JA017073"> JGR Space Physics</a>.

*My first lead-author article, and culmination of an ambitious 2-season fieldwork expedition in Antarctica. The paper shows the capability of ionospheric tomography using an improved network of ground receivers. Multiple geodetic GNSS receivers are now distributed across the frozen continent, monitoring stuff like sea ice thickness and movement, and we can use their signals to improve wide-area ionospheric imaging (once you trudge across the ice to recover the data!). We resolved ionospheric 'patches' of electron density moving over the south pole in response to a geomagnetic storm, causing GNSS signals - measured using independent receivers - to fluctuate (see below section on radio scintillation).*

*A nice collaborative paper following an ESA-funded international workshop hosted by the South African National Space Agency (SANSA). We worked with multiple institutions to quantify the achievable resolution and accuracy of ionospheric imaging in Africa, and simulated optimum ground network locations for future GNSS receivers.*

* **Kinrade, J.** (2014), "Ionospheric Imaging and Scintillation Monitoring in the Antarctic and Arctic." PhD thesis, accessible through the <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/ionospheric-imaging-and-scintillation-monitoring-in-the-antarctic"> University of Bath</a>.

*Listed because I (stupidly) never published the chapter covering north hemisphere imagery. Lovely resolution of the mid-latitude electron density trough over Europe (although this does make an appearance in this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/swe.20027"> Space Weather</a> article by Baumgardner et al. 2013). The first ever resolving of a full auroral oval morphology imaged in Total Electron Content (TEC) using GNSS tomography. This  was verified with DMSP satellite particle data + UV imagery, plus incoherent scatter radar scans from the PFISR in Alaska. My PhD work received the University of Bath's competitive Ede & Ravenscroft Award for best postgraduate research.*

### Earth's Ionosphere: Radiowave Scintillation

At high latitudes, solar activity and space weather can disturb the ionosphere (driving the auroras) as energetic particles hurtle down the magnetic field lines and impact the upper atmosphere. Subsequent turbulence can refract and scatter the propagation of GNSS signals, which then fluctuate not unlike the  twinkling of a star. This phenomenon is known as *scintillation*.  It also occurs at low latitudes because of equatorial heating effects. GNSS receivers don't like scintillation, and it can degrade positioning accuracy in systems demanding high precision  (airports, oil rigs, glacial tracking). But, conversely, it lets you use GNSS receivers to probe atmospheric phenomena like the auroras.
